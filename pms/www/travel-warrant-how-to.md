## Step 0: Fill in your associate details (only needed once)

If you have done this step in the past, skip to step 1.

1. Go to _[Home > Documentation > Associate](/desk#List/Associate/List)_ and click **New** button.
    - Alternatively, type `New Associate` in the search bar at the top.
2. Fill in your details.
    - _Default status_ is your default status on courses (Asistent / Stručni saradnik / ...)
    - _Phone_ - if you don't have a landline phone, enter your mobile phone twice.
3. Click **Save** button at the top (or `Ctrl+S`).

## Step 1: Add yourself to the course

1. Go to _[Home > Documentation > Course](/desk#List/Course/List)_
    - Alternatively, type `Course List` in the search bar at the top.
2. Select the course you are on.
3. Open the _ASSOCIATES_ collapsible section.
4. Click _Add row_ button (under the table).
    - If your row is already added (e.g. by the course manager) skip to step 2.
5. Start typing your name in the _Associate_ column, and select your associate entry.
6. Enter your arrival and departure times.
7. Click **Save** button at the top (or `Ctrl+S`).

## Step 2: Create and print the travel warrant

1. Go to the row in the _ASSOCIATES_ table from the last step.
2. Expand the row using the ▼ at the far right of the row.
    - If your Associate Status is different from your default status, change it here.
3. Click on the _Create Travel Warrant_ button. A new travel warrant should be created.
4. Scroll to the bottom past all the filled in details.
5. If you have arrived using some form of **public transport** (bus / train), open the _PUBLIC TRANSPORT_ section.
    - Create a row and fill in the details for each bus/train ticket you had or will have.
    - If you have one-way tickets, be sure to attach them with the printout.
    - If you have return tickets, be sure to create a photocopy, and attach them with the printout.
6. If you have arrived using your **own transport**, open the _OWN TRANSPORT_ section.
    - Fill in the travel details.
7. Click the **Save** button (or `Ctrl+S`).
8. Check the form details for any potential mistakes.
    - If there are any, fix them either in your _Associate_ document created in step 0, or 
      in your row in the _Course_ document in the _Associates_ table.
9. Click the **Submit** button, and confirm submission.
10. Click the printer icon at the top.
11. Click **Print**.
